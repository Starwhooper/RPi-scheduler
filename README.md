Based on https://github.com/Starwhooper/RPi-433outlets. The RPi-433outlets used a local 433MHz transmitter. 
The https://github.com/Starwhooper/RPi-scheduler send the commands to a ESP01 with 433 transmitter. The benefit of this solution is, that the stearing RPi could place in your Server-Rack and on any other place in your wlan, your clould place the ESP near your outlets.

The sketch and wiring on ESP01, could you find here: https://alexbloggt.com/funksteckdosensteuerung-mit-esp8266/
